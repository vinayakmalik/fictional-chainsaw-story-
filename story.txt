there was once a legendary character named zarton he was op as hell amd killed everyone and then something happened.. Zarton 
was on the receiving end of the largest nerf anyone had ever seen. He found himself plummeting from the ranks of diamond to 
a lowly bronze recruit. How could this have happened? It took Zarton a while to realize what actions had caused his suffering.

One day, Zarton went to the training grounds and saw a news hologram with his
face saying "disgraced Zarton should give up". He decided to watch further,
and the newscast said "He was so cool before, but look at him now! Shameful!"
Zarton knew exactly who was behind this...
